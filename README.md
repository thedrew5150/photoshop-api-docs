# Welcome to Photoshop APIs!

The Adobe Photoshop APIs will allow you to make both layer and document level edits to Photoshop PSD files.  This page is meant to help you onboard with the service and get you started with some basic usage examples.

The API documentation is published at

[Photoshop API Documentation](https://adobedocs.github.io/photoshop-api-docs/)

[Lightroom API Documentation](https://adobedocs.github.io/lightroom-api-docs/)


# General Setup and Onboarding

## Authentication

We have two kinds of authorizations.
1. OAuth 2.0 access token for individual user access
2. JSON Web Token (JWT) for service integration for Adobe Enterprise ETLA customers only

### Adobe Enterprise ETLA customers
If your company has an Adobe ETLA agreement you may be able to create your own integration using the instructions below. You may generate a user access token using an OAuth 2.0 workflow, or, a service token.

#### OAuth 2.0 Guide  

 - Instructions regarding the Adobe IMS endpoints can be found at [Generating Access Tokens](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/OAuth/OAuth.md#authentication)
 - Additional instructions can be found at [Setting up OAuth authentication](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/OAuth/OAuth.md)
 - An OAuth playground can be found [here]([https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/Resources/Tools/ToolsOverview.md](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/Resources/Tools/ToolsOverview.md))
 - Complete examples for OAuth endpoints can be found at [OAuth endpoint examples]([https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/OAuth/samples/samples.md](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-auth/master/OAuth/samples/samples.md))


### Service-to-service clients

For service-to-service clients you'll need to set up an Adobe I/O Console Integration and create a JSON Web Token (JWT) to retrieve your access token for Photoshop APIs. It is assumed your organization already has an Adobe IMS Org ID and you have added the required users to it.


#### Assets stored on Adobe's Creative Cloud

The Adobe Photoshop APIs currently have a limitation that Service clients must store their assets externally to Adobe's Creative Cloud...

#### Assets stored externally to Adobe
This applies to assets stored outside of Adobe's Creative Cloud and accessed via preSigned URL's

- Browse to https://console.adobe.io/integrations
- Select New Integration
- Select `Access an API`
- Select `Photoshop`
- Select `Service Account integration`
- Select `Create new integration`

To retrieve your access token see additional instructions at [Setting up JWT Authentication](https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html#!adobeio/adobeio-documentation/master/auth/JWTAuthenticationQuickStart.md)

## API Keys

Also known as the `client_id`. You must additionally pass in your Adobe API key in the `x-api-key` header field. You’ll automatically get a developer API key when you create your Adobe I/O Console Integration.  After you've created your integration you can find your API key in the `Overview` tab of your Integration

## Retries

- The service will retry status codes of 429, 502, 503, 504 three times.
- You should only retry requests that have a 5xx response code. A 5xx error response indicates there was a problem processing the request on the server.
- You should implement an exponential back-off retry strategy with 3 retry attempts.
- You should not retry requests for any other response code.

## Rate Limiting

We have not put a throttle limit on requests to the API at this time.

# Photoshop

## General Workflow

The typical workflow involves retrieving a PSD document manifest file via `/documentManifest` (a JSON representation of the documents layer tree), followed by one or more calls to `/documentOperations` to optionally edit the PSD and/or create new image renditions. Both endpoints are asynchronous so the response will contain the `/status` endpoint to poll for job status and results

### Input and Output file storage

Clients can use assets stored on one of the following storage types:
1. Adobe: by referencing the path to the files on Creative Cloud
2. External: (like AWS S3) by using a presigned GET/PUT URL
3. Azure: By generating a SAS (Shared Access Signature) for upload/download
4. Dropbox: Generate temporary upload/download links using https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer/


### SmartObject

The Photoshop APIs currently support creating and editing of Embedded Smart Objects.

- In order to update an embedded smart object that is referenced by multiple layers you only need to update one of those layers, the effect will be reflected in all layers referencing the same smart object.

- The replaced smart object takes the bounds of the new image by default. If your document contains transparent pixels (e.g some .png) , you may not get consistent bounds.

The API's are documented [here](https://adobedocs.github.io/photoshop-api-docs/#api-Photoshop-document_operations)

We also have an example of replacing a Smart Object within a layer.

[Smart Object Example Code](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/photoshop-api-docs#example-6-swapping-the-image-in-a-smart-object-layer)


### Tracking document changes

If you are making multiple edits to a PSD during the course of a user session it is your decision on how you want to track and store changes from one version of a PSD to another. Some clients will choose to refresh the document's JSON manifest by calling `/documentManifest` again after each call to `/documentOperations`. Other clients may choose to cache the changes locally and then make one final call to `/documentOperations` with the original PSD and the accumulated changes requested by the user.

## Supported Features

This is a partial list of currently supported features.  Please also see the [Release Notes](https://forums.adobeprerelease.com/photoshopapiservice/categories/releasenotes) for a list of added features

### Layer level edits

- General layer edits
  - Edit the layer name
  - Toggle the layer locked state
  - Toggle layer visibility

### Rendering / Conversions

- Create a new PSD document
- Create a JPEG, TIFF or PNG rendition of various sizes
- Request thumbnail previews of all renderable layers
- Convert between any of the supported filetypes (PSD, JPEG, TIFF, PNG)

#### Compatibility with Photoshop versions

1. The API’s will open any PSD created with Photoshop 1.0 through the current release and this will always be true.
2.  When saving as PSD, the API’s will create PSD’s compatible with the current shipping Photoshop.
3.  In regards to “maximize compatibility” referenced in [https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/file-formats.html#maximize_compatibility_for_psd_and_psb_files](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/file-formats.html#maximize_compatibility_for_psd_and_psb_files)  the API's default to “yes”

## How to use the APIs

The API's are documented at https://adobedocs.github.io/photoshop-api-docs/

### /documentManifest (Retrieving a PSD manifest)

#### Example 1: Initiate a job to retrieve a PSD's JSON manifest

The `/documentManifest` api can take one or more input PSD's to generate JSON manifest files from. The JSON manifest is the tree representation of all of the layer objects contained in the PSD document. Using Example.psd, with the use case of a document stored in Adobe's Creative Cloud, a typical curl call might look like this:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/documentManifest \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -d '{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "href":"files/Example.psd",
      "storage":"adobe"
    }
  ]
}'
```

This initiates an asynchronous job and returns a response containing the href to poll for job status and the JSON manifest.
```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/status/63c6e812-6cb8-43de-8a60-3681a9ec6feb"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Poll for status and results

Using the job id returned from the previous call you can poll on the returned `/status` href to get the job status and, upon success, the JSON Manifest

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/status/63c6e812-6cb8-43de-8a60-3681a9ec6feb \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

#### Example 3: The returned manifest

Once your job completes (and does not report any errors) the status response will contain your document's JSON manifest along with other metadata about the input document. The JSON Manifest is further described in the [api docs](https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/dice/pie-in-the-sky/#api-Documents-document_manifest_status)

    }
  }
}
```

### /documentOperations (Making PSD edits and renders)

Once you have your PSD file's JSON manifest you can use it to make layer and/or document level edits to your PSD and then generate new renditions with the changes. You can pass in either all or a subset of the JSON manifest to `/documentOperations` as represented in the request body's `options.layers` argument. In other words you can choose to pass `options.layers` as a flat array of only the layers that you wish to act upon and can, if desired, leave out the rest.

The layer id or layer name are used by the service to identify the correct layer to operation upon in your PSD; Note that adding a new layer does not require the ID to be included, the service will generate a new layer id for you.

#### The add, edit and delete objects

The `add`, `edit`, `move` and `delete` blocks are how you communicate that you'd like action taken on that particular layer object. Any layer block passed into the API that is missing the one of these attributes will be ignored.

#### Example 1: Making a simple edit
```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/documentOperations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"  \
  -H "x-api-key: $apiKey" \
  -d '{
  "inputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/Example.psd",
      "storage":"adobe"
    }
  ],
  "options":{
    "layers":[
      {
        "edit":{},     
        "id":750,
        "index":1,
        "locked":true,
        "name":"HeroImage",
        "type":"smartObject",
        "visible":true
      }
    ]
  },
  "outputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/Example_Out.psd",
      "storage":"adobe",
      "type":"vnd.adobe.photoshop",
      "overwrite":true
    }
  ]
}
'
```

#### Example 2: Creating new Renditions

See the `/renditionCreate` examples below as the format for the `outputs` object in the request body is identical

#### Example 3: Swapping the image in a smart object layer

In this example we want to swap the smart object in an existing embedded smart object layer, the Hero Image layer in Example.psd. We are requesting the following:

- The `edit` key is included to indicate we want to edit this layer
- The `layers.input` object is included to indicate where the replacement image can be found
- The `layers.smartObject` object is included to indicate specific information related to this image as SO

All the files used in the example are available in [sample_files](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/photoshop-api-docs/tree/master/sample_files). You can download the files and put it in your CC account or any storage(AWS, Azure or Dropbox).

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/documentOperations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"  \
  -H "x-api-key: $apiKey" \
  -d '{
  "inputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/Example.psd",
      "storage":"adobe"
    }
  ],
  "options":{
    "layers":[
      {
        "edit":{},     
        "input":{                                       
          "href":"files/heroImage.png",  
          "storage":"adobe"
        },
        "smartObject" : {                
        	"type" : "image/png"
        },
        "attributes":{
          "bounds":{
            "height":515,
            "left":-385,
            "top":-21,
            "width":929
          }
        },
        "id":750,
        "index":1,
        "locked":false,
        "name":"HeroImage",
        "type":"smartObject",
        "visible":true
      }
    ]
  },
  "outputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/Example_Out.psd",
      "storage":"adobe",
      "type":"vnd.adobe.photoshop",
      "overwrite":true
    }
  ]
}
'
```

### /renditionCreate (Generating New Renditions)

The `/renditionsCreate` endpoint can take a number of input PSD files and generate new image renditions or a new PSD

##### Example 1: A single file input

In this example we are requesting two different outputs from our Example.psd input:

- Example.jpeg is a new JPEG rendition that has a width of 512 pixels
- Example.png is a new fullsize PNG rendition


```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/renditionCreate \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -d '{
  "inputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/Example.psd",
      "storage":"adobe"
    }
  ],
  "outputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/Example.jpeg",          
      "width": 512,
      "storage":"adobe",
      "type":"image/jpeg"      
    },
    {
      "href":"files/Example.png",
      "storage":"adobe",
      "type":"image/png"
    }
  ]
}

```

This initiates an asynchronous job and returns a request body containing the href to poll for job status and requested rendition information.

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/status/de2415fb-82c6-47fc-b102-04ad651c5ed4"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Poll for status and results

Using the job id returned from the previous call you can poll on the returned `/status` href to get the status for each requested output

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/status/de2415fb-82c6-47fc-b102-04ad651c5ed4 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

This will return a request body containing the job status for each requested output

```json
{
  "jobId":"de2415fb-82c6-47fc-b102-04ad651c5ed4",
  "outputs":[
    {
      "input":"/files/Example.psd",
      "status":"succeeded",
      "created":"2018-01-04T12:57:15.12345:Z",
      "modified":"2018-01-04T12:58:36.12345:Z",
      "_links":{
        "renditions":[
          {
            "href":"files/Example.jpeg",          
            "width": 512,
            "storage":"adobe",
            "type":"image/jpeg"    
          },
          {
            "href":"files/Example.png",
            "storage":"adobe",
            "type":"image/png"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/status/de2415fb-82c6-47fc-b102-04ad651c5ed4"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example 3: A folder input (multiple files)

In this example we are requesting new full size jpeg renditions from an input folder containing multiple PSD documents.

Note that the `outputs` object is using file tokens, $FileName, to create new files with the same names as the input files found

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/renditionCreate \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -d '{
  "inputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/my_input_folder",
      "storage":"adobe"
    }
  ],
  "outputs":[
    {
      "href":"files/$FileName.jpeg",           // <--- THE $FileName TOKEN
      "storage":"adobe",
      "type":"image/jpeg",
    }
  ]
}
'
```
### /smartObject (Replacing smartobject)

The `/smartObject` endpoint can take an input PSD file with an embedded smartobject and can replace with another smartobject.
This API is a simple API developed to ease the smartObject replacement workflow for an user.

##### Example 1: Replacing a SmartObject
This example shows how you can replace an embedded smart object

``` shell
curl - H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
- H "x-api-key: $api_key" \
- X POST \
https: //image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/smartObject \
- d '{
  "inputs": [
  {
    "href": "files/SOCreate.psd",
    "storage": "adobe"
  }],
  "options": {
    "layers": [{
      "name": "New",
      "input": {
        "href": "files/jt-guitar.jpeg",
        "storage": "adobe"
      }
     }
    ]
  },
  "outputs": [
  {
    "storage": "adobe",
    "href": "files/SOedit.psd",
    "type": "vnd.adobe.photoshop"
  }
  ]}'

```

##### Example 2: Creating a SmartObject
This example shows how you can create an embedded smart object

``` shell
curl - H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
- H "x-api-key: $api_key" \
- X POST \
https: //image.adobe.io/pie/psdService/smartObject
- d '{
  "inputs": [
  {
    "href": "files/SO.psd",
    "storage": "adobe"
  }],
  "options": {
    "layers": [{
      "name": "New",
      "add": {
        "insertTop": true
      },
      "input": {
        "href": "files/jt-drums.jpeg",
        "storage": "adobe"
       }
      }
    ]
  },
  "outputs": [
  {
    "storage": "adobe",
    "href": "files/SOCreate.psd",
    "type": "vnd.adobe.photoshop"
  }
]}'

```
## Sample Code

The [sample_code](sample_code) folder in this repo contains sample code for calling the Photoshop APIs.

Note that the sample code is covered by the MIT license.


## Current Limitations
There are a few limitations to the APIs you should be aware of ahead of time.  
- Multi-part uploads and downloads are not yet supported
- The /documentOperations and /smartObject endpoints only support a single PSD input


The file Example.psd is included in this repository if you'd like to experiment with these example calls on your own.


# Lightroom APIs

The Adobe Lightroom APIs allow you to make Lightroom-like automated edits to image files.

## General Workflow

The typical workflow involves making an API POST call to the endpoint https://image.adobe.io/lrService/ for which the response will contain a link to check the status of the asynchronous job. Making a GET call to this link will return the status of the job and, eventually, the links to your generated output.

## How to use the API's

The API's are documented at [https://github.com/AdobeDocs/lightroom-api-docs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/lightroom-api-docs/)
